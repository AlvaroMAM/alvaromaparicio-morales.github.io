### Minimizing Deployment Cost of Hybrid Applications
Within Quantum Software Engineering, the development of hybrid classical-quantum applications is an active research topic. Concretely, there is a focus on the usage of microservices architectures to offer quantum functionalities through classical service gateways. However, while there are methodologies and tools to automatically determine the best deployment for classical applications, this is not the case for hybrid applications, which are especially complicated to deploy due to their specific quantum-requirements. In this paper, we propose Cost Minimizer, a tool to determine the most cost-effective classical and quantum machines to deploy hybrid microservice-based applications. We believe Cost Minimizer will be a step towards achieving a better interaction between classical and quantum computing systems.
